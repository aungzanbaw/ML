## Differentiable programming
Def: Simple gradient based optimization of parameters in the program
How: Work by constructing a graph containing the control flow and data structures in the program
* Static, compiled graph based approaches such as TensorFlow
* Operator overloading, dynamic graph based approaches such as PyTorch
