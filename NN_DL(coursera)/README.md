# Neural Networks and Deep Learning
This is the part of series from deeplearning.ai 

## Week1
1. Most of the DL booms come from
* computing power & specific hardwares like GPUs & TPUs
* huge data from daily usage of digital devices 
* new algorithms (ML concepts are not new)

2. DL thrive mostly on **supervised learning**
3. Pratically used on 
* Search 
* Recommendation
* Image recognition (tagging, categorizing, detection etc)
* Translation
* Text <=> Speech
